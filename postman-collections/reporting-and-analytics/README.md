# Data APIs Postman collections

The Reporting and Analytics (R&A) Data APIs provide customized and dynamic access to all data in Oracle Hospitality Reporting and Analytics through a powerful GraphQL interface. This API enables you to retrieve precisely the data you need from the R&A system, optimized specifically for reporting purposes and organized into logical Subject Areas.

The Postman collection uses the [oracle-hospitality Postman Environment](../oracle-hospitality.postman_environment.json).
