Oracle Hospitality OPERA Cloud Services are a cloud-based, mobile-enabled platform for next generation hotel management. OPERA Cloud offers an intuitive user interface, comprehensive functionality for all areas of hotel management, secure data storage, and hundreds of key partner interfaces to meet the needs of hotels of all types and sizes. By moving property management technology to the cloud, OPERA Cloud simplifies the IT infrastructure in properties, allowing hotel management and staff to focus on delivering exceptional guest experiences.
